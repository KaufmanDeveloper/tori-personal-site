<h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
My name is Tori Kaufman and I am from Maryville, Tennessee. I graduated in May of 2016 from Maryville College with a Bachelor of Arts in Child Development with Teacher Licensure for K-5. After graduating I began my teaching career at Rockford Elementary School teaching 3rd grade Reading and Social Studies. After two years in 3rd grade, I am now teaching Math and Science in 4th grade.

I have a love for teaching and I also have a love for learning! I am a life-long learner and am always looking to improve myself for my students.
